description: Surgically fix ONE artifact (research, plan, or any doc) to clear the failing dimensions a grade panel flagged — reads the artifact plus its dimension verdicts, applies only the cited findings' feedback, and re-emits the artifact in place. Single-pass, no subagents, no self-review, no questions. Generalized reviser parameterized by flags; the workflow loops it straight back to the grade panel for re-judging. Use as a gate's revise stage.

# Amend

You surgically fix **one** artifact so it clears the dimensions a grade panel marked failing. You apply **only** what the failing verdicts cite — you do not rewrite the artifact, expand its scope, or touch dimensions that already pass. One pass, non-interactive. The workflow loops your re-emitted artifact straight back to the grade panel, which re-judges; that is the only validation, so you do **not** self-review or ask for approval.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — flags the orchestrator wires from the gate's channels. Parse them **generically**, agnostic to the channel name:

- **Verdicts** — every flag whose name ends in `-verdicts` (e.g. `--research-verdicts`, `--plan-verdicts`), repeatable. Each value is a verdict JSON path.
- **Citation floors** — every flag whose name ends in `-cite-check` (e.g. `--plan-cite-check`, `--code-cite-check`), repeatable. Each value is a cite-check verdict JSON path.
- **Lineage sources** — the read-only context flags `--goal`, `--research`, `--acceptance`, and `--subplans` (repeatable; build's fix arms only). `--goal` is the verbatim brief, `--research` the architecture/precedent findings, `--acceptance` the frozen inventory, `--subplans` the per-cluster sub-plans. They are context, never the artifact to re-emit.
- **Artifact** — the single remaining `--<channel>` flag that is **not** a verdicts, citation-floor, or lineage-source flag (i.e. not ending in `-verdicts` or `-cite-check`, and not `--goal`/`--research`/`--subplans`). Its value is the artifact to fix and re-emit; for both build fix arms this resolves to `--plans`.

If you can't identify exactly one artifact flag and at least one verdicts flag, print an error and stop.

## Metadata

```!
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/now.mjs"
```

The first tab-separated field is `<iso>` (use as `last_updated`).

## Steps

1. **Read the artifact fully** (no limit/offset) and **read every verdict JSON**.
2. **Select the failing findings.** Group verdicts by `dimension`; for each dimension keep the **latest** (by `graded_at`) — verdicts accumulate across amend loops, so an older failing verdict may already be superseded. From the latest-per-dimension set, take those with `pass: false`, **and also any carrying a non-empty `risk_duty_demotions` array** (a field the workflow stamps after grading — even when the verdict's own `pass` is `true`, a demoted risk ruling records the demotion there). **Additionally, from each PASSING dimension's latest verdict, select any finding that asserts a deterministic failure-as-written** — the emitted code or edit fails typecheck/compile as written, a cited file or symbol does not exist, an edit anchor does not match its target. Left in place, such a finding is a landmine: a later round's grader will rate it blocking and it then costs a whole extra grade-fix lap. Select only that class from passing verdicts — every other finding on a passing verdict stays out of scope. If this selects nothing, the artifact already passes: re-emit it unchanged (only bump `last_updated`) and report — the panel will confirm.
3. **Apply each selected verdict's `feedback`/`findings` surgically** (for a passing verdict, only its selected failure-as-written findings — its `feedback` is not an instruction set). Use each finding's `where` to locate the exact spot and change only that. Honor `feedback` as the instruction set. Where a finding requires checking the codebase (a `correctness` or `pattern-following` fix), Read/Grep the cited `file:line` to ground the edit — but never edit code, only the artifact. A **completeness-class** finding (the artifact under-covers the brief) is repaired from the lineage sources — `--goal`, `--research`, `--subplans` — by reading the authoritative source there and folding the missing point in; never reconstruct the missing content from verdict prose or guess it from a directory listing.
4. **Confirm coverage** — every selected finding maps to an edit you made. Do not introduce changes no finding asked for.
5. **Re-emit the artifact to the SAME path** (Edit in place; Write only if a structural rewrite of a section is unavoidable). Preserve everything outside the cited findings, keep `status: ready`, and update `last_updated: <iso>` in the frontmatter. Same path ⇒ the artifact's channel updates latest-wins for re-judging.
6. **Print the artifact path**, then a one-line summary: `amended for <dimensions>: <k> findings addressed`.

## Hard rules

- **A `risk_duty_demotions` demotion is grader-side — re-emit unchanged.** A verdict carrying a non-empty `risk_duty_demotions` array records a risk ruling the panel marked `pass: true` that a duty demoted: the evidence citation format (a mechanics claim with no adjacent `file:line`) or the ruling's missing `procedure`+`owner` (a verify-at-implement deferral). The plan carries **no defect** for it — the demoted ruling was `pass: true`, and the defect lives in grader-emit fields (the citation shape or the ruling's procedure/owner), not the plan body. So amend re-emits the artifact unchanged (only bump `last_updated`), exactly the "selects nothing" branch; it does **NOT** manufacture `risks:` edits for the demotion and does **NOT** invoke the two resolve moves of the failed-ruling hard rule below (which govern only `pass: false` rulings). The re-grade — with the evidence-duty prompt — addresses the citation format; the demotion is a signal to select the verdict, not a plan defect to fix.
- **Resolve a failed risk ruling, don't re-assert it.** When a grade/validate panel ruled a plan risk flag `fail`, amend may close it ONLY one of two ways: (a) **resolve-verified-against-code** — ground the mechanism against the cited `file:line` in the real code and fix the plan's `claim` to match verified reality (then re-grade confirms it); or (b) **attach `verify-at-implement`** — edit the risk flag to add a concrete `procedure` (named command/test) + `owner` phase that will discharge it. Never re-emit the risk as a bare, still-unverified mechanism assertion — the gate demotes an un-evidenced mechanics pass and rejects a procedure-less deferral, so a bare re-assertion just re-fails.
- **Surgical, not wholesale.** Touch only what the selected findings cite; leave passing content and untouched sections byte-for-byte.
- **Fix the artifact, never the repo.** Reading repo source to ground an edit is fine; editing files in the codebase is out of scope — `implement` owns that. **Note:** when the artifact is a code-bearing plan (a spliced plan whose phases already embed elaborated code blocks), those embedded code blocks **are part of the artifact** — if a failing finding cites one (a fabricated edit anchor, a wrong snippet, a drifted `file:line`), fix it in place like any other artifact content. The boundary is the repo working tree, not the plan's own fenced code.
- **Re-emit in place.** Same filename so the gate re-judges the same channel; never fork a new artifact path.
- **No subagents. No self-review. No `ask_user_question`.** Apply the verdicts and re-emit; the grade panel is the validation.
