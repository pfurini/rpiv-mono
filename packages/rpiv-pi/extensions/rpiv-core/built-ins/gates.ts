 * fail the gate should have blocked on was erased from the channel;
 * (3) a sentinel with NO dimension is skipped by this fold — absence is not
 * failure — so the gate folded only the four surviving passes and routed
 * onward. The dimension field closes all three: the unresolved dimension now
 * reads as its own latest, blocking entry. (Mirror: an UNFILLED slot — infra

 *     fix instead would lap an unchanged plan against an unchanged lazy
 *     judgment until the backward-jump guard halted it;
 *   - a FLAP — the dimension previously passed and now blocks on the same
 *     artifact (a broad re-grade regressing a carried pass), i.e. the exact
 *     single-judge instability the confirm exists to adjudicate.
 *
 * A first-time MEDIUM finding-driven blocker routes straight to the fix:
 * amend is surgical and cheap (observed under a minute), and the delta
 * re-grade guard keeps the re-judgment narrow — a wrong medium now costs one
 * lean fix lap instead of every medium costing a confirm session.
 *
 * No tier guard is needed: a blocking verdict is medium+ by the severity
 * floor, and a medium+ severity already lifts `gateTier` out of light — every
