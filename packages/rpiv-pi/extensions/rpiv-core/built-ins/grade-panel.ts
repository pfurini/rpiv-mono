/**
 * A grade panel: one `grade` session per dimension over the latest artifact on
 * `channel`. Each unit's prompt is the `grade` skill's flags
 * (`--dimension <d> --artifact <path>`); the per-dimension verdicts fold via
 * `allDimensionsPass`. Shared by the slice gate (over `slices`) and the plan +
 * code gates (over `plans`), each on its own `verdictChannel`.
 *
 * The panel grades the tier's ROSTER (`gateTier`/`gateRoster`), over verdicts
 * still FRESH for the current artifact (`freshVerdicts`) — a light run grades
 * two dimensions, a regenerated artifact re-grades from scratch. On a re-grade
 * it emits ONLY the dimensions `dimensionsToRegrade` says still need it (the
 * rest carry their prior passing verdict forward) — but never an EMPTY set: an
 * empty `units()` return falls through to a single dimensionless `grade`
 * dispatch, so when nothing needs re-grading we fall back to the full roster.
 * The route into the stage already skips it entirely when the accumulated
 * verdicts clear the gate (see `plan-cite-check`/`code-cite-check`/`slice-check`
 * edges), so this fallback only fires in the degenerate case where a fix left the
 * cite floor red while every dimension passed.
 *
 * `architecture-fit` is the one dimension `grade` requires a `--context` for: it
 * grades the plan against the research the slices rest on. The build flow always
 * front-loads a `research` stage, so we thread the latest `research` artifact in
 * as `--context` for that dimension only; likewise the latest `goal` artifact
 * threads in as `--goal` for the `GOAL_DIMENSIONS` only. Every other dimension
 * (and the slice gate's `design-readiness`, which never grades fit or
 * goal-completeness) gets the bare flags.
 *
 * `--prior` threads a dimension's latest fresh verdict when that dimension is
 * still pending (a confirm or re-grade of a blocking prior — the grader must
 * adjudicate the prior findings, not out-vote them) and always on correctness
 * and on the risk unit (their re-grades scope to the prior). A carried
 * passing prior on any other dimension is not re-adjudicated. Round 1 emits
 * no flag.
 *
 * The `RISK_DIMENSION` unit joins the roster through `panelRoster` whenever
 * the graded channel declares `risks:` — bare flags plus `--prior`: no
 * `--goal` (the goal-contradiction class stays with correctness), no
 * `--cite-check` (resolution is correctness's lead source), no `--context`.
 *
 * Every panel wires `haltWhenAllFailed: true`: a generation in which EVERY
 * dispatched dimension unit failed is a dead panel — nothing was collected, so
 * there are no verdicts to fold — and the run halts at the panel's own close
 * instead of routing the gate machinery over an empty verdict channel.
