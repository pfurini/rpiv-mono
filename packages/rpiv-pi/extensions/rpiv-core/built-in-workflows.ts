 * `pass: false` risk rulings plus its structured `blockers:` entries; a
 * `verdict: fail` carrying NEITHER (run 2026-08-22_12-14-12-64eb: two
 * whole-plan gate failures recorded only in report prose) has no handle the
 * arm may act on, so routing it to `validate-fix` buys a provably futile lap
 * — the arm drift-escapes without an edit and the unchanged tree re-validates
 * to the identical verdict until the backward-jump guard halts the run. Such
 * a fail STOPs at the gate with a route note naming why (the ship-gate
 * `setRouteNote` pattern; a noted decision stop records as a halt). The
 * repair-arm authority rule the slice gate learned the same way: a gate may
 * only loop into an arm whose authority covers the failure class.
 *
 * A factory (not one shared EdgeFn) for the scopeFloorGate reason — each
 * workflow's route-note symbol must never alias the other's. `maxFixRounds`
 * caps the remediation hops a remediable fail may buy: each `validate-fix`
 * pass publishes exactly one digest on the `remediation` channel, so the
 * channel length IS the rounds already spent. Build passes no cap (the
 * runner's backward-jump guard is its budget); ship caps at ONE — the single
 * bounded hop its stop-on-fail identity concedes (run 7299: a docs-gap
 * `fail` at the last stage stranded ~50 min of verified implementation).
 *
 * Reads the `validation` channel (validate's contract-derived publish bucket
 * — a prompt stage owns its message and can't inherit its contract's output
 * schema, so the gate folds the channel, never the raw stage output). A
 * missing/unexpected verdict stays terminal STOP, exactly as the `match` it
 * replaces — un-anticipated data can never route INTO commit OR the repair arm.
